## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I am interested in this dataset because like the description states, safe water is a basic human right. Clean drinking water is an essential need for humans and I was intrigued to see what quality metrics and factors determine whether that water is potable or not. Seeing this dataset also reminded me of a first year chemistry lab where we looked at the hardness of different water samples, which I found very interesting. I hope to dive deeper into the World Health Organisation standards for the potability of water. I think conducting more research about the water quality metrics standards will allow me to understand this dataset more. I also hope to possibly explore what types of bodies of water are potable and why. Exploring the reasons as to what makes water not safe to drink can bring more knowledge as to why investing in cleaner water supplies is so crucial. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset contains some water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. This dataset contains columns: pH value, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and potability. The data was synthetically generated, so it does not have an actual source. I believe this dataset is for public health interest and learning. The dataset uses the different water quality metrics to determine if the water is potable (1) or if it is not safe to drink (0). The data also uses World Health Organisation to determine whether the pH, conductivity, etc are within WHO standards. Although, since this data is synthetic it does come with limitations. The data is stated to be from different bodies of water, but the types are not listed which can limit the assessment of the data. Additionally, we cannot accurately examine what types of water is potable depending on the water quality metrics.
